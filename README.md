# Road-Construction-Management-System-Using-DBMS

This project is about Road Construction Management System leveraging SQL for database operations like joins, subqueries, and constraints, alongside normalization techniques for data integrity. Additionally, I utilized EDAW (Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization) to graphically represent insights, facilitating informed decision-making in road construction planning and management.
